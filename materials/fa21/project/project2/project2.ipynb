    "**Deadline.**  This project is due at **11:59pm PT on Friday, 11/05**. You can receive 5 bonus points for submitting the project by **11:59pm PT on Thursday, 11/04.** Projects will be accepted up to 2 days (48 hours) late. Projects submitted fewer than 24 hours after the deadline will receive 2/3 credit, and projects submitted between 24 and 48 hours after the deadline will receive 1/3 credit. We will *not accept* any projects that are submitted 48 hours or more after the deadline. **There will be no lenience with late submissions.** That includes if you miss the deadline due to internet or submission issues. Please submit early if you anticipate this being a problem. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.**  For full credit, you must complete a checkpoint. For the checkpoint, you must complete the questions up until **the end of Part 2**, pass all public autograder tests for those sections, and submit to the Gradescope Project 2 Checkpoint assignment by **11:59pm PT on Friday, 10/29**. This checkpoint is worth 5% of your entire project grade. There is no partial credit for the checkpoint, and we do not accept late checkpoint submissions. After you've submitted the checkpoint, you may still change your answers before the project deadline -- only your final submission, to the Project 2 assignment, will be graded for correctness. You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab and leave time to finish the checkpoints afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner; your partner must be from your assigned lab section. **Only one person is required to submit to the checkpoint and project assignments. On Gradescope, the person who submits *must* also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.** Once you submit, click into your submission, and there will be an option to Add Group Member in the top right corner. You may also reference [this walkthrough video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1POtij6KECSBjCUeOC_F0Lt3ZmKN7LKIq/view?usp=sharing) on how to add partners on Gradescope. Make sure to **re-add your partner every time you make a new submission**, as Gradescope does not save partner information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Ed, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Ed post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your TA or tutor for help. You can find contact information for the staff on the [course website](http://data8.org/fa21/staff.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** The tests that are given are **not comprehensive** and passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work! You might want to create your own checks along the way to see if your answers make sense. Additionally, before you submit, make sure that none of your cells take a very long time to run (several minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Free Response Questions:** Make sure that you put the answers to the written questions in the indicated cell we provide. **Every free response question should include an explanation** that adequately answers the question. Your written work will be uploaded to Gradescope automatically after the project deadline; there is no action required on your part for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated task, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. \n",

    "You **never** have to use just one line in this project or any others. Use intermediate variables and multiple lines as much as you would like!\n",

    "### The Nurses' Health Study\n",
    "The Nurses' Health Study (NHS) is another very large observational study which has brought many insights into women's health. It began in 1976, by Dr. Frank Speizer, with questionnaires that were mailed to 121,964 female registered nurses in the United States asking about their medical history, cholesterol and blood pressure, current medications, and so on (one of the benefits of studying nurses is their ability to give reliably accurate answers to these questions). \n",
    "\n",
    "The study's initial focus was on investigating the long-term health effects of oral contraceptives, whose use had become much more widespread in the U.S. during the 1960s, but the focus soon expanded to investigating a wide variety of questions on women's health. The NHS is still ongoing, and is now tracking its third generation of nurses in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "**One of the most consequential early findings from the NHS was about hormone replacement therapy (HRT)**: supplementary estrogen and progesterone for post-menopausal women to relieve side effects of declining hormone levels due to menopause. The NHS found that HRT in post-menopausal women was negatively associated with heart attack risk. In other words, higher levels of HRT in post-menopausal women were associated with lower risk of heart attack. In a landmark 1985 paper in the *New England Journal of Medicine* (NEJM), Speizer and his coauthors wrote that **women on HRT are half as likely to suffer a heart attack over a certain time period.** [(Stampfer et al., 1985)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4047106) We'll define the term \"relative risk\" later in this section, and we'll also investigate the interpretation of these claims and their statistical basis."
